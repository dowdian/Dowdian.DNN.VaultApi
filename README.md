# DNN Azure Key Vault Web API
## Introduction {#introduction}
>__Please Note__: 
>This solution is broken for the moment because of a _lot_ of breaking fixes all at once. I'm working on fixing it. I'll remove this message when it's ready to go.

>These instructions are accurate as of May 30, 2024. If you're reading this in the future (which I presume you are), you may need to adjust the instructions to match the current state of the Azure portal. This is what made creating this project so damn hard. _All_ the instructions, tutorials and sample projects I could find were convoluted and/or out of date. This goal of this project is to create a simple project that people (i.e: me) can learn from.

This document is (or will be) boken up into four sections:
1. [Certificate Setup](#certificates) - You'll need to this no matter how you want to use this solution.
1. [Installing the module locally](#localinstall) - This is for using the API in a development environment on your local machine.
1. [Installing the module in Azure](#azureinstall) - This is for using the API in an Azure App Service instance.
1. [Setting up the development environment](#development) - This is for stepping through or modifying the code, or (if you're feeling _very_ generous) contributing to the project lotüôè.
1. [Using the API](#use) - Once you have the solution set up, this is how you can use the API to manage secrets either locally in the web.config or in Azure Key Vault.

This solution was built using the [Upendo DNN Generator](https://github.com/UpendoVentures/generator-upendodnn#readme). If you're already familiar you'll have a head start, but if you're not don't worry. We'll walk through the set up from the beginning.

This project is at the proof of concept stage. The end goal is to manage secrets stored in Azure Key Vault in the most secure way possible. There may well be some obvious gaps. Please point them out with kindness.

This solution:
 - Uses a self-signed 4096 bit certificate to authenticate to Azure Key Vault. 
 - Uses a seperate self-signed 4096 bit certificate to encrypt sections of the web.config files.
 - Includes basic CRUD methods for managing the Secrets implemented as Web API methods available to authenticated processes within a DNN instance. 
 - Does not modify the schema of the DNN database.
 - Can be used either in a development environemnt (localhost) or in an Azure App Service instance. These instructions focus on a localhost setup (for now).

## Certificate Setup {#certificates}
You'll need to create two self-signed certificates. One to authenticate to the Key Vault and the second to encrypt and decrypt sections of the web.config. 
>In the context of certificates, there are generally two types of keys: signature keys and exchange keys.
> - Signature keys are used to create digital signatures for authenticity and integrity. They are used to verify that data hasn't been tampered with and that it originates from the specified source.
> - Exchange keys, on the other hand, are used for encrypting and decrypting the symmetric key in secure communications. In a typical secure communication, the symmetric key is used to encrypt the actual message data, and then the symmetric key itself is encrypted with the recipient's public exchange key. The recipient can then use their private exchange key to decrypt the symmetric key, and then use that to decrypt the actual message.

Let's start things off with the signature key certificate.
1. Create a new folder to store your certificates and their related files.
1. Open a PowerShell window as an administrator and navigate to your new folder.
1. Run the following command to create a self-signed signature key certificate in your current directory. This will cause Windows to ask you to enter a password three times across two dialogs. Leaving it blank is not an option:
    ```powershell
    makecert ‚Äìr -n "cn=DnnVaultApiSignature" DnnVaultApiSignature.cer -sv DnnVaultApiSignature.pvk -b 05/30/2024 -e 06/30/2024 -len 4096
    ```
    > - `-r` creates a self-signed certificate.
    > - `-n` specifies the subject name of the certificate.
    > - `-b` specifies the start date of the certificate.
    > - `-e` specifies the end date of the certificate.
    > - `-len` specifies the length of the key.
    > - `DnnVaultApiSignature.cer -sv DnnVaultApiSignature.pvk` specifies the output file names for the certificate and the private key file.


    > __Note__: When I copied and pasted this command into the command prompt, it didn't work. I had to type it out manually. I'm not sure why. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1. Run the following command to get the thumbprint of the certificate. You'll need this value later:
    ```powershell
    Get-PfxCertificate -FilePath .\DnnVaultApiSignature.cer | fl Thumbprint
    ```
1. Run the following command to extract the combined certificate and private key into a new Personal Information Exchange (PFX) file:
    ```powershell
    pvk2pfx -pvk DnnVaultApiSignature.pvk -spc DnnVaultApiSignature.cer -pfx DnnVaultApiSignature.pfx -pi <password>
    ```
    > Replace `<password>` with the password you chose when creating the certificate.

Now you should have three files in your new certificates folder and a thumbprint value stashed away somewhere safe (I typically use my password manager.). Next up, let's create the exchange key certificate. It's pretty much a line-for-line repeat of the signature key process with just a few small differences.
1. Run the following command to create a self-signed exchange key certificate in your current directory:
    ```powershell
    makecert -r -n "cn=DnnVaultApiExchange" -sky exchange DnnVaultApiExchange.cer -sv DnnVaultApiExchange.pvk -b 05/18/2024 -e 06/18/2024 -len 4096
    ```
    > - `-sky exchange` specifies the subject's key type. Here, `exchange` means it's an exchange key.

1. Run the following command to get the thumbprint of the certificate:
    ```powershell
    Get-PfxCertificate -FilePath .\DnnVaultApiExchange.cer | fl Thumbprint
    ```
1. Run the following command to create the PFX file:
    ```powershell
    pvk2pfx -pvk DnnVaultApiExchange.pvk -spc DnnVaultApiExchange.cer -pfx DnnVaultApiExchange.pfx -pi <password>
    ```
    > Replace `<password>` with the password you chose when creating the certificate.

Now you should have _six_ files in your new certificates folder and two thumbprint values stashed away. This should be all you need to [install the API locally](#localinstall), [installing in Azure](#azureinstall), or [setting up the development environment](#development). üéâ

## Installing the API locally {#localinstall}

## Installing the API in Azure {#azureinstall}

## Development Environment Setup {#development}
### DNN Setup
To begin, let's get DNN and the project set up.
1. Clone this repository to a directory close to the root of your local machine (to avoid any potential issues with long paths).
1. Create a new folder in the root of the solution called `Website`.
1. Give the `NETWORK SERVICE` account full permissions on the `Website` directory to allow IIS to read and write to the directory.

    ![Folder permissions](./ReadMeImages/dnn-step-01.png)
1. Unzip a [fresh copy of DNN](https://github.com/dnnsoftware/Dnn.Platform/releases) into the new `Website` directory.
1. Create a database in your local SQL Server instance using the following script:
    ```sql
    USE [master]
    GO
    CREATE DATABASE [YourDatabaseName]
        CONTAINMENT = NONE
        ON  PRIMARY ( NAME = N'[YourDatabaseName]', FILENAME = N'[FolderWhereDatabaseFilesGo]\[YourDatabaseName].mdf' , SIZE = 8192KB , FILEGROWTH = 65536KB )
        LOG ON ( NAME = N'[YourDatabaseName]_log', FILENAME = N'[FolderWhereDatabaseFilesGo]\[YourDatabaseName]_log.ldf' , SIZE = 8192KB , FILEGROWTH = 65536KB )
     WITH LEDGER = OFF
    GO

    USE [YourDatabaseName]
    GO
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT name FROM sys.filegroups WHERE is_default=1 AND name = N'PRIMARY') ALTER DATABASE [YourDatabaseName] MODIFY FILEGROUP [PRIMARY] DEFAULT
    GO
    ```
	> Replace `YourDatabaseName` and `FolderWhereDatabaseFilesGo` with appropriate values.
1. Run the following SQL Script against your new database to allow IIS to attach to it using the `NETWORK SERVICE` account:
	```sql
	USE [YourDatabaseName]
	GO
	CREATE USER [NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE]
	GO
	ALTER AUTHORIZATION ON SCHEMA::[db_owner] TO [NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE]
	GO
	ALTER ROLE [db_owner] ADD MEMBER [NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE]
	GO
	```
	> Replace `YourDatabaseName` with the appropriate value.
    
    ![Database permissions](./ReadMeImages/dnn-step-05.png)

1. Open IIS Manager and add an Application under the Default Web Site with the following settings:
	- Alias: `DnnVaultApi`
	- Physical Path: `C:\[PathToYourProjectDirectory]\Website`
        > Replace `PathToYourProjectDirectory` with the appropriate value.
	- Application Pool: `DefaultAppPool`
	    > Note: If you already have applications running under your DefaultAppPool, you may want to create a new AppPool for this application.
1. Modify the DefaultAppPool (or the AppPool of your choice) to use the `NETWORK SERVICE` account as its identity.

    ![Database permissions](./ReadMeImages/dnn-step-07.png)
1. Using your favorite browser, navigate to `http://localhost/DnnVaultApi` to complete the DNN installation process      .
	- Give the host user a password.
    - Database Setup: `Custom`
    - Database Type: `SQL Server/SQL Server Express Database`
    - Server Name: `(local)`
	- Database Name: `YourDatabaseName`
	- Security: `Integrated`
    - All other values can be left as their default values.
1. Now, with DNN installed, we can move over to building and installing the DnnVaultApi. Open the solution in Visual Studio and build it in **Release mode**. This will create the installer files in the `.\Website\Install\Modules` directory.

1. Install the `DnnVaultApi` module in the DNN instance.
    1. ![Database permissions](./ReadMeImages/dnn-step-13.1.png)
    1. ![Database permissions](./ReadMeImages/dnn-step-13.2.png)
    1. ![Database permissions](./ReadMeImages/dnn-step-13.3.png)

### Permissions
1. Run the following command to install the certificate on your local machine:
    ```powershell
    certutil -f -p <password> -importpfx .\DnnVaultApiExchange.pfx
    ```
    > Replace `<password>` with the password you chose when creating the certificate  .

1. Lastly, you'll need to give the `NETWORK SERVICE` account full permissions on the certificates so that our IIS process will have access to them.
1. Open the Certificates MMC snap-in by running `certlm.msc` in the Run dialog.
1. Navigate to `Personal > Certificates`.
1. Right-click on the `DnnVaultApiSignature` certificate and select `All Tasks > Manage Private Keys`.
1. Add the `NETWORK SERVICE` account with `Full Control` permissions.
1. Right-click on the `DnnVaultApiExchange` certificate and select `All Tasks > Manage Private Keys`.
1. Add the `NETWORK SERVICE` account with `Full Control` permissions.

### Azure Setup
1. If you don't already have an Azure account, you can create one for free [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/). 
1. You will also need to create an App Registration in Azure Active Directory to uniquely identify your DNN instance. This will be used to authenticate to the Key Vault. You can follow the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).
    1. Be certain to add a redirect URI ([details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app#add-a-redirect-uri)).
    1. Upload the public key of the certificate to the App registration in Azure Active Directory ([details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app#add-a-certificate)).
   > Make note of the `Application (client) ID` and the `Directory (tenant) ID` as you will need these later.
1. If you don't already have a Azure Key Vault associated with you Azure account, you can create one by following the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/secrets/quick-create-cli#create-a-key-vault).
   > make note of the URI of the Key Vault as you will need this later.
1. Give the App registration the necessary permissions to access the Key Vault. You can follow the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/secrets/quick-create-cli#assign-a-role-to-the-app-registration).

Now you should be all set to use the API to Create, Read, Update, and Delete secrets in your Azure Key Vault. üéâ

## Using the API {#use}
1. First, you'll need to make one more change to your web.config file. Add the following app settings to the `<appSettings>` section:
	```xml
	  <add key="TenantId" value="[Directory (tenant) ID]" />
	  <add key="ClientApplicationId" value="[Your Application (client) ID]" />
	  <add key="Thumbprint" value="[Your Certificate Thumbprint]" />
	  <add key="KeyVaultUri" value="[Your Vault URI]" />
	```
	> Replace `[Directory (tenant) ID]`, `[Your Application (client) ID]`, `[Your Certificate Thumbprint]`, and `[Your Vault URI]` with the values you collected earlier.
    This step will change in the near future as I intend to encrypt one or more sections of the web.config to hide these values properly.
1. Using your favorite browser, log into your DNN instance.
1. Open Dev Tools and navigate to the Console tab.
1. Run the following JavaScript code to test the API by creating a new secret named "DnnVaultApiTestValue" with a value of "SuperSecretValueHandleWithCare":
    ```javascript
    const url = '/DnnVaultApi/API/DnnVaultApi/DnnVaultApi/CreateSecret?secretName=DnnVaultApiTestValue&secretValue=SuperSecretValueHandleWithCare';
    const options = {
        method: 'GET',
        headers: {
            beforeSend: $.ServicesFramework(0)
        }
    };
    new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        fetch(url, options)
            .then(response => {
                if (response.ok) {
                    return response.json();
                } else {
                    console.log('Damn. Something went wrong on the server.');
                    console.log(response);
                    reject(response);
                }
            })
            .then(json => {
                console.log(json);
                resolve(json);
            })
            .catch(error => {
                cosole.log('Damn. Something went wrong on the client.');
                console.log(error);
                reject(error);
            });
    });
    ```
      This should return a message indicating that the secret was created successfully.
	```
	A new secret with the name DnnVaultApiTestValue has been successfully created in the Vault.
    ```
1. Run the following JavaScript code to test the API by retrieving the value of the secret you just created (notice that the only thing changed is the URL):
    ```javascript
    const url = '/DnnVaultApi/API/DnnVaultApi/DnnVaultApi/GetSecret?secretName=DnnVaultApiTestValue';
    const options = {
        method: 'GET',
        headers: {
            beforeSend: $.ServicesFramework(0)
        }
    };
    new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        fetch(url, options)
            .then(response => {
                if (response.ok) {
                    return response.json();
                } else {
                    console.log('Damn. Something went wrong on the server.');
                    console.log(response);
                    reject(response);
                }
            })
            .then(json => {
                console.log(json);
                resolve(json);
            })
            .catch(error => {
                cosole.log('Damn. Something went wrong on the client.');
                console.log(error);
                reject(error);
            });
    });
    ```

You should see the following output in the console:
```
SuperSecretValueHandleWithCare
```



### Next Steps:
1. Encrypt one or more sections of the web.config file using a seperate certificate so that the `[Directory (tenant) ID]`, `[Your Application (client) ID]`, `[Your Certificate Thumbprint]`, and `[Your Vault URI]` values are well hidden.

### Conclusion
I have been told that the best way to ask for help online is to make a statement with absolute certainty and wait for the good folks of the world to tell you how wrong you are. With this in mind, I can say with the utmost conviction that the above instructions will work perfectly for you. If they don't, please let me know so that I can correct them. üôè
